# Hotel Booking Analytics: Cancellation in Hotel Booking  
### Created by: Hilfi Biyan Firza

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze hotel booking data and build a predictive model to identify whether a booking will be canceled or not. With cancellation rates ranging from 20% to 70%—especially high during the COVID-19 pandemic—such a model can help hotel management take proactive steps to reduce revenue loss and optimize room allocation.

## 🎯 Business Problem
High cancellation rates negatively impact hotel revenue and operational efficiency. Without predictive insights, hotels cannot anticipate or mitigate these risks. The goal is to:
- Predict booking cancellations using machine learning models.
- Understand key factors influencing cancellations to inform better business strategies.

## 👥 Stakeholders
- **Hotel Operations Manager**: For managing room availability.
- **Marketing Team**: To target high-risk customers with tailored offers.
- **Customer Service**: To proactively engage with customers likely to cancel.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Build a machine learning model to classify bookings as likely to be canceled or not.
2. Identify the most influential features behind booking cancellations.
3. Provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

## 🔍 Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering and Selection
- Modeling using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Model Evaluation using:
  - Recall (especially for class 1 – cancellations)
  - F1 Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC AUC

## 📈 Success Metrics
- Recall for cancellation class (1) ≥ 80%
- Precision for class 1 ≥ 60%
- ROC AUC ≥ 0.80

## 💡 Business Impact
By implementing this model, hotels can:
- Reduce financial losses due to cancellations.
- Improve operational planning and workforce allocation.
- Tailor communication and promotions for at-risk bookings.
